                              Hi, I'm Gerianne. I'm a career <em>Shifter</em> who decided to dive into the world of <em>Code</em>.
                               My educational background and work experience are in International Relations but somewhere along the way, I decided to do something else: I wanted to code.
                               Since working in Tech is a new adventure for me,I wanted to share my experiences, the good and bad, and hopefully along the way, I could help others with their transition as a coder. Thus, Shift&amp;Code was born.
                                <br>
                              </p>

                              <p>If you're interested in shifting as well, then join me in this new chapter of my life and stay posted.
                                <br>Maybe you can find something useful for you too.

                            To be honest, I didn't consider venturing into Coding right away. I thought of other industries I could work in because of the idea that, perhaps
                            I just lost interest in my job. So I thought that if I transfer to a different work place or a different industry, then maybe I'll be happy with
                            my job again. So I considered becoming a Paralegal, going to Law School, enrolling in Grad School, becoming a Writer, and I even considered working
                            for any related positions at other companies. Well, out of all of them, I got into Grad School. About the same time I got accepted, I saw an ad
                            for a Front End Web Dev Course. Now to be clear, I had an idea about coding because I coded back in Middle School and also through
                            FreeCodeCamp.
                        </p>
